# Python-Live-Project
For the Python Live Project I got to put the skills that I learned on the python course to use. I was able to be a part of a team effort but working mostly on my own. Below are some code snippets and skills that I learned going through the project. I was able to learn how to navigate Django and extend my knowledge of that platform. Below is a portion of my project including [front end stories](#front-end-stories) and [back-end stories](#back-end-stories).


## Front-End Stories
* Creating the Basic App:<br>
On this story I was able to use creativity and create my own application website that I would like to track data of. I chose to make a coffee shop website.

## Back-End Stories
* Creating a Model:<br>
Created a model and added migration, included an object manager for accessing the database. In this story I also created a model form that included all inputs that would be necessary for the user's input then added a template for user to be able to add a new item to the database. Also added a views function that rendered the create page and utilized the model form to save the collection item to the database.

## Other Skills Acquired
* Time-Management was a HUGE skill that I learned on this project, taking the time to get all requirements done in an efficient manner helped me on my C# project where I was able to get a lot more accomplished.
* Team-work and reaching out to peers was a part of my learning process on this project. I was able to get advice and give advice on the stories that I had completed.
* Gained confidence in my work and knowledge that I had learned from the Python Course.
